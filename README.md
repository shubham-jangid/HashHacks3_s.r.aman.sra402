## Abstract 🎇

### Problem statement 🤔

- People **do not get informed of the real time situation** of their close one who is admitted in ICU 📈.

- Fraud happens by the authority of presenting the fake data to the relatives and **charge them huge sum of money 💰 for no cause**.

- **Keeping the medical history of a person in an organized manner 📑** that is easily accessible to the person and for the doctor who is going to treat also.

### Proposed Solution 😎

- **By keeping the track of the data on a Block-chain ⛓** network in **real time ⏳** directly from machine with an analysis (to make easily understandable) so that their close ones can see the status.
- This will provide a **robust model which is not interfered by any human being 🤬** and ultimately will lead to **Fraud Free health-care system 👩‍⚕️**.

- The patient's data is updated on a block-chain network. It will keep the **history of the person health throughout his/her life 📄** & Doctors who are treating him or her **can see the history and treat accordingly 💉**.
